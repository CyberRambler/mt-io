# Tutorial End-to-End

## Prepare Dataset

Prepare a dataset in the following format:
```
|- [NAME_DATASET]/
|   |- metadata.csv
|   |- wavs/
|       |- file1.wav
|       |- ...
```

Where `metadata.csv` has the following format: `id|transcription`. This is a ljspeech-like format; you can ignore preprocessing steps if you have other format datasets.

Note that `NAME_DATASET` should be `[ljspeech/kss/baker/libritts/synpaflex]` for example.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing has two steps:

1. Preprocess audio features
    - Convert characters to IDs
    - Compute mel spectrograms
    - Normalize mel spectrograms to [-1, 1] range
    - Split the dataset into train and validation
    - Compute the mean and standard deviation of multiple features from the **training** split
2. Standardize mel spectrogram based on computed statistics

To reproduce the steps above:
```
tts/bin/preprocess --rootdir ./[ljspeech/kss/baker/libritts/thorsten/synpaflex] --outdir ./dump_[ljspeech/kss/baker/libritts/thorsten/synpaflex] --config preprocess/[ljspeech/kss/baker/thorsten/synpaflex]_preprocess.yaml --dataset [ljspeech/kss/baker/libritts/thorsten/synpaflex]
```

Right now we only support [`ljspeech`](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), [`kss`](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/korean-single-speaker-speech-dataset), [`baker`](https://weixinxcxdb.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/gwYinPinKu/BZNSYP.rar), [`libritts`](http://www.openslr.org/60/), [`thorsten`](https://github.com/thorstenMueller/deep-learning-german-tts) and
[`synpaflex`](https://www.ortolang.fr/market/corpora/synpaflex-corpus/) for dataset argument. In the future, we intend to support more datasets.

**Note**: To run `libritts` preprocessing, please first read the instruction in bin/fastspeech2_libritts. We need to reformat it first before run preprocessing.

After preprocessing, the structure of the project folder should be:
```
|- [NAME_DATASET]/
|   |- metadata.csv
|   |- wav/
|       |- file1.wav
|       |- ...
|- dump_[ljspeech/kss/baker/libritts/thorsten]/
|   |- train/
|       |- ids/
|           |- LJ001-0001-ids.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-feats/
|           |- LJ001-0001-raw-feats.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-f0/
|           |- LJ001-0001-raw-f0.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-energies/
|           |- LJ001-0001-raw-energy.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- norm-feats/
|           |- LJ001-0001-norm-feats.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- wavs/
|           |- LJ001-0001-wave.npy
|           |- ...
|   |- valid/
|       |- ids/
|           |- LJ001-0009-ids.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-feats/
|           |- LJ001-0009-raw-feats.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-f0/
|           |- LJ001-0001-raw-f0.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- raw-energies/
|           |- LJ001-0001-raw-energy.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- norm-feats/
|           |- LJ001-0009-norm-feats.npy
|           |- ...
|       |- wavs/
|           |- LJ001-0009-wave.npy
|           |- ...
|   |- stats.npy
|   |- stats_f0.npy
|   |- stats_energy.npy
|   |- train_utt_ids.npy
|   |- valid_utt_ids.npy
|- examples/
|   |- melgan/
|   |- fastspeech/
|   |- tacotron2/
|   ...
```

- `stats.npy` contains the mean and std from the training split mel spectrograms
- `stats_energy.npy` contains the mean and std of energy values from the training split
- `stats_f0.npy` contains the mean and std of F0 values in the training split
- `train_utt_ids.npy` / `valid_utt_ids.npy` contains training and validation utterances IDs respectively

We use suffix (`ids`, `raw-feats`, `raw-energy`, `raw-f0`, `norm-feats`, and `wave`) for each input type.


**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
- This preprocessing step is based on [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) so you can combine all models here with other models from ESPnet repository.
- Regardless of how your dataset is formatted, the final structure of the `dump` folder **SHOULD** follow the above structure to be able to use the training script, or you can modify it by yourself ðŸ˜„.

# Abstract Class Explaination

## Abstract DataLoader Tensorflow-based dataset

A detail implementation of abstract dataset class from dataset/abstract_dataset. There are some functions you need overide and understand:

1. **get_args**: This function return argumentation for **generator** class, normally is utt_ids.
2. **generator**: This function have an inputs from **get_args** function and return a inputs for models. **Note that we return a dictionary for all generator functions with the keys that exactly match with the model's parameters because base_trainer will use model(\*\*batch) to do forward step.**
3. **get_output_dtypes**: This function need return dtypes for each element from **generator** function.
4. **get_len_dataset**: Return len of datasets, normaly is len(utt_ids).

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

- A pipeline of creating dataset should be: cache -> shuffle -> map_fn -> get_batch -> prefetch.
- If you do shuffle before cache, the dataset won't shuffle when it re-iterate over datasets.
- You should apply map_fn to make each element return from **generator** function have the same length before getting batch and feed it into a model.

Some examples to use this **abstract_dataset** are tacotron_dataset.py, fastspeech_dataset.py, melgan_dataset.py, fastspeech2_dataset.py


## Abstract Trainer Class

A detail implementation of base_trainer from trainer/base_trainer.py. It include Seq2SeqBasedTrainer and GanBasedTrainer inherit from BasedTrainer. All trainer support both single/multi GPU. There a some functions you **MUST** overide when implement new_trainer:

- **compile**: This function aim to define a models, and losses.
- **generate_and_save_intermediate_result**: This function will save intermediate result such as: plot alignment, save audio generated, plot mel-spectrogram ...
- **compute_per_example_losses**: This function will compute per_example_loss for model, note that all element of the loss **MUST** has shape [batch_size].

All models on this repo are trained based-on **GanBasedTrainer** (see train_melgan.py, train_melgan_stft.py, train_multiband_melgan.py) and **Seq2SeqBasedTrainer** (see train_tacotron2.py, train_fastspeech.py).
